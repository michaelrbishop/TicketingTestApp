# TicketingTestApp
An ASP.Net Core app to generate/scan QR tickets and collect money via Stripe

# Built (Early) March 2022 - (Late) April 2022
This was a one off test to see what might be involved to create my own ticketing app for a live event. Most of the action on this one is happening server side in the C# code. A more update to date version using React/Asp.Net is being created.
